# Projects

These are some of my completed projects, I have others that are more complex, but they are not done yet so I decided to share these instead.

To run these projects-:
* Use VSCode or any other suitable IDE
* select the project you want to open with the command 'cd name-of-prooject'
* Once inside the prooject run the coommand 'npm i' to install the dependencies
* Once all dependencies are installed, run the 'npm start' command to run the application

Kind Regards,
Abram Leshika
